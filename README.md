## <p align=center>What's on my plate</p>

#### Splash X6

Haven't you heard? There's a new indie game in town! 
  
[A college buddy](https://github.com/Dylan773) and I venture to develop a game inspired by the likes of the origional Anno and Civilisation games. A studitory project which is diving us into the world of the LibGDX engine, Kotlin, and every other tool that's making the game possible!
    
### Here's a quick look!

Check out the repository [here](https://github.com/Pheonix-org/SplashX6). 


#### WheelyCat's Project Torte.

Recently, I was Co-lead to a ~10 man development team behind the now archived [torte](https://github.com/WheelyCatStudios/torte) RPG game project. The project has since been replaced by [Project Torte](https://github.com/WheelyCatStudios/Project-Torte), and the structure of command has been abolished in favour of a more friendly level plane.
