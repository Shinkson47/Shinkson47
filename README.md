## <p>What's on my plate</p>

#### Splash X6

Haven't you heard? There's (another) new indie game in town!
  
[A college buddy](https://github.com/Dylan773) and I venture to develop a game inspired by the likes of the origional Anno and Civilisation games. A studitory project which is diving us into the world of the LibGDX engine, Kotlin, and every other tool that's making the game possible!
    
### Here's a quick look!
